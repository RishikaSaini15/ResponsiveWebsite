          <p><strong>Course Details</strong></p>
          <p>This course will be divided into two parts, approximately divided by our spring break in mid-March. The first part of the course
          will focus almost entirely on the client-side part of the Web—that is, the technologies that are available within a
          Web browser. These core technologies include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): used to provide structure to Web pages.</li>
            <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): used to provide design to Web pages.</li>
            <li>Javascript: used to provide interactivity to Web pages.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Our introduction to Javascript will cover several weeks and will include an introduction to fundamental
            concepts that appear in nearly all programming languages including variables, conditional expressions, loops and
            functions. For students already familiar with these concepts some optional intermediate-to-advanced Javascript concepts
            will be presented.</p>
          <p><strong>Key concepts introduced in this part of the course will include:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>In-depth understanding of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol</li>
            <li>Connecting Web applications to central data stores</li>
            <li>User authentication best practices</li>
            <li>Using AJAX to communicate with Web servers without reloading entire Web pages</li>
            <li>Web API design including REST concepts</li>
            <li>Web security</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Course Structure</strong></p>
          <p>This course is being conducted online and the majority of interaction between course members will be
            asynchronous. The course will include Readings (possibly also including videos), Discussions, Assignments
            (including final projects), Exams and Conferences (including office hours). The detailed syllabus of the
            course can be accessed here.<a href="https://ischool.umd.edu/sites/default/files/syllabi/inst_765_syllabus_spring_2020.pdf"

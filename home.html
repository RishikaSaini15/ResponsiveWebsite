          <p>Non-programmers will learn basic programming and how to develop familiarity with web formatting and
            programming paradigms, including XML, REST, APIs, and authentication schemes. The class begins with an
            introduction to basic programming and students build on those skills by programming applications that use
            web-based data and services.</p>
          <p>* Prerequisites: None. All programming concepts will be introduced as needed.</p>

            This course will not, by itself, turn students into professional-level Web developers. However, upon
            successful completion of the course, students should expect to:

          <ul>
            <li>Have a high-level understanding of fundamental Web technologies including HTML, HTTP, CSS, Javascript,AJAX, REST and server-side scripting.</li>
            <li>Understand foundational programming concepts like variables, conditional logic, iteration and functions.</li>
            <li>Be able to build simple but useful real-world Web applications, including applications that integrate with centralized data stores.</li>
            <li>Have a good ability to communicate with Web programming professionals about their work, and be able to make informed decisions regarding selection of Web technologies and architectures.</li>
